# MiniMax Tree

MiniMax is a branch of game theory where the idea is you want to minimise the maximum loss. Typically there are two players involved, one attempts to
maximise the score while the other attempts to get as low a score as possible. At each node they alternate who chooses the next branch to go down.

In this challenge, your aim is to construct the Minimax tree given all the potential outcomes. The first move is made by Player One, whose goal is to maximise their potential score.
